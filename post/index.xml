      <description>Collaborated with team of 5 to create an application that estimates the expensive patient in the healthcare system and provide actionable insight to reduce the healthcare cost. Cleaned over 7 thousand patient records from 7 Northeastern US states such as Connecticut,Maryland,Massachusetts,New Jersey,New York,Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Build visualizations using R to determine the factors leading to higher medical cost. Optimized Linear,Logit Regeression,Neural Network, Association Rule, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to reach the best model.</description>

      <description>This is my self study project where I build Machine Learning Model for predicting Breast Cancer using kaggle dataset.The model I build will be helpful in selecting whether the tumour is begnin or malignant. Build visualizations using python to determine which characteristics of tumor determines its severity of breast cancer. Achieved 92.2% accuracy in determining the type of breast cancer using Decision Tree Classifier model. Performed Hyperparameter tuning on all models to avoid overfitting and to achieve ideal model architecture.</description>

      <description>Worked in team of 4 to build a database management system to display available cars, car owner details, customer credit score to the customer support officer. Enforced integrity using integrity constraint and database triggers. Gathered requirements from business analysis, developed Logical and Conceptual model using draw.io. Improved database performance and optimized SQL queries by 70% loading speed using database defragmentation. Link to GitHub Repository</description>
